# Code Presentation and Documentation

## Introduction
This code is an HTML document that demonstrates real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js and the BlazeFace model. It uses the web camera to capture video frames, and then applies the BlazeFace model to detect faces in the frames. The detected faces are displayed on the video canvas with optional landmarks, detection probability, and face position information.

## Code Structure
The HTML code consists of the following sections:
- CSS Styles: Defines the layout and appearance of the page.
- JavaScript Libraries: Imports TensorFlow.js and the BlazeFace model.
- HTML Body: Contains the video canvas, overlay canvas, controls section, and message display.
- JavaScript Code: Handles camera initialization, face detection, checkbox events, and other operations.

## Installation and Setup
To run this code, you need a web browser with [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and [BlazeFace](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/blazeface) libraries imported. No additional installation is required as the libraries are loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) using the script tags in the HTML code.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Grant permission to use your web camera when prompted.
3. The video stream from your camera will be displayed on the canvas.
4. Detected faces will be outlined with rectangles.
5. Optionally, you can enable/disable the display of landmarks, probability, and face position by checking/unchecking the corresponding checkboxes in the control section.
6. If "Change Color Based on Confidence" is checked, the face rectangles will be colored based on the confidence of detection.
7. The number of detected faces will be shown in the message display.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following libraries:
- TensorFlow.js: Used for machine learning operations and loading the model.
- BlazeFace: A pre-trained face detection model.

Both libraries are loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) using the script tags in the HTML code.
